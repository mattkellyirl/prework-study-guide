# Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This web application was created as a place to store my notes while completing my University of Adelaide Coding Bootcamp pre-work modules. While completing the pre-work modules, I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge I gained straight away at the proper industry standard. This application contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript which are all vital to developing a properly functioning application.
